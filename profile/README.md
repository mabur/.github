[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) makes visualization infrastructure for computer vision and robotics.

Log images, meshes, point clouds, and other rich data just like you would log text. Get a deep understanding of what your code is doing with minimum effort.

We are a Rust shop, and we're using [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui) to create an app that works on desktop as well as on the web.

You can follow our co-founder (and egui creator) Emil on twitter at <https://twitter.com/ernerfeldt>.
