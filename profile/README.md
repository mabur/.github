[__Rerun beta will be publicly available on February 15th!__](https://twitter.com/ernerfeldt/status/1621134904238170112)

[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is and SDK (in Python and Rust) for logging rich data like point clouds, images, and tensors. Those logs are then visualized live or recorded in the Rerun Viewer. 

It's basically print-f style debugging for computer vision and robotics. Over time, the goal is to build the modern visualization stack for real world AI.

We are a Rust shop, and we're using [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui), [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), and [`arrow2`](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2) create an app that is flexible, fast, and works on desktop as well as on the web.

At Rerun we believe that a healthy open source ecosystem is a net positive for the world. We will strive to make a lot of our work open source. We will also contribute to open source projects via issues, pull requests, and sponsorship. We track our contributions [here](https://github.com/rerun-io/opensource).
