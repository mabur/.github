[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) makes visualization infrastructure for computer vision and robotics.

Log images, meshes, point clouds, and other rich data just like you would log text. Get a deep understanding of what your code is doing with minimum effort.

We are a Rust shop, and we're using [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui) to create an app that works on desktop as well as on the web.

At Rerun we believe that a healthy open source ecosystem is a net positive for the world. We will strive to make a lot of our work open source. We will also contribute to open source projects via issues, pull requests, and sponsorship. We track our contributions [here](https://github.com/rerun-io/opensource).  

Currently we are working on the Rerun open source project in a private repo together with a small group of early users. We will release the project in 2023. If you want to get early access, sign up for the [waitlist](https://5li7zhj98k8.typeform.com/to/IeCL0ERA) and include some background on what you want to use Rerun for.

You can follow our co-founder (and egui creator) Emil on twitter at <https://twitter.com/ernerfeldt>.
